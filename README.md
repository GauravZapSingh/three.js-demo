# Three.js Demo
My first attempt to learn and explore [Three.js library](https://threejs.org/) back in 2020. The library is very well documented and shows the different  dimension of 3D technology using JavaScript.<br />
I was amazed to see what this library can achieve. You can check some examples here - https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_skinning_blending

- Built by combining multiple models (.obj files) into a single model 
- Used [Three.js library](https://threejs.org/) which provides 3D functionality of rotating, zooming, selecting, hover effects, etc.
